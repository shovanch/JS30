## Notes from Lesson 02

* `transform-origin` property works along the x-axis of the element. 0% value means start transforming from the extreme left, 50% from the middle, 100% from the extreme right.
* transition-timing-function : How the transition will play out over a period of time.
* We can execute a function continously after a certain period of time using `setinterval(callback fn, time_in_msec)`
